      This site is first and foremost, an opportunity the Lord has given me to
      assist and serve others with technology. I have felt led by the Holy
      Spirit to create this website to help out those who are less
      technologically inclined to offer helpful tips and streamline resolving
      common issues they may have with modern tech. Along with the tips, helpful
      links to brand websites are provided.
